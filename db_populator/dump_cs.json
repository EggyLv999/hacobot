    "description": "A technical introduction to the fundamentals of programming with an emphasis  on producing clear, robust, and reasonably efficient code using top-down  design, informal analysis, and effective testing and debugging. Starting  from first principles, we will cover a large subset of the Python  programming language, including its standard libraries and programming  paradigms.  We will also target numerous deployment scenarios, including  standalone programs, shell scripts, and web-based applications.  This course assumes no prior programming experience. Even so, it is a  fast-paced and rigorous preparation for 15-122.  Students seeking a more  gentle introduction to computer science should consider first taking 15-110.    NOTE: students must achieve a C or better in order to use   this course to satisfy the pre-requisite for any subsequent Computer   Science course.",

Teaches imperative programming and methods for ensuring the correctness of programs.  Students will learn the process and concepts needed to go from high-level descriptions of algorithms to correct imperative implementations, with specific application to basic data structures and algorithms.  Much of the course will be conducted in a subset of C amenable to verification, with a transition to full C near the end. This course prepares students for 15-213 and 15-210.  NOTE: students must achieve a C or better in order to use  this course to satisfy the pre-requisite for any subsequent Computer  Science course.",

    "description": "An introduction to programming based on a \"functional\" model of computation.  The functional model is a natural generalization of algebra in which programs are formulas that describe the output of a computation in terms of its inputs---that is, as a function.  But instead of being confined to real- or complex-valued functions, the functional model extends the algebraic view to a very rich class of data types, including not only aggregates built up from other types, but also functions themselves as values.  This course is an introduction to programming that is focused on the central concepts of function and type.  One major theme is the interplay between inductive types, which are built up incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function.  Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules, and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation.    NOTE: students must achieve a C or better in order to use   this course to satisfy the pre-requisite for any subsequent Computer   Science course.",

This course has the purpose of introducing first-year Computer Science students to elements of formal logic as well as to the historical context in which this discipline developed. As all subsequent courses in the CS curriculum rely on students having mastered basic logical notions and skills, it will test and enhance your preparation, thereby putting you in a better position to succeed in the program. It will also help you understand and appreciate how CS came about since Computer Science grew out of logic. The specific knowledge and skills you will learn in is course include: an enhanced ability to research topics, give presentations and write technical prose, some elementary logic, some historical depth into Computer Science, mathematics and logic itself. This course is open to Computer Science freshmen only.",

    "description": "15-213/18-213\n\nThis course provides a programmer's view of how computer systems execute programs, store information, and communicate. It enables students to become more effective programmers, especially in dealing with issues of performance, portability and robustness. It also serves as a foundation for courses on compilers, networks, operating systems, and computer architecture, where a deeper understanding of systems-level issues is required. Topics covered include: machine-level code and its generation by optimizing compilers, performance evaluation and optimization, computer arithmetic, memory organization and management, networking technology and protocols, and supporting concurrent computation. NOTE FOR GRADUATE STUDENTS: This course is not open to graduate students beginning Spring 2015. Graduate students must register for 15-513 instead.",

    "description": "Software engineers today are less likely to design data structures and algorithms from scratch and more likely to build systems from library and framework components. In this course, students engage with concepts related to the construction of software systems at scale, building on their understanding of the basic building blocks of data structures, algorithms, program structures, and computer structures. The course covers technical topics in four areas: (1) concepts of design for complex systems, (2) object oriented programming, (3) static and dynamic analysis for programs, and (4) concurrent and distributed software. Student assignments involve engagement with complex software such as distributed massively multi-player game systems and frameworks for graphical user interaction.",

It aims to help students compose clear, concise technical writings and oral  presentations for multi-level audiences.  Assignments include technical  definitions, descriptions, instructions, process explanations, abstracts,  memos, and research reports.  Assignments may incorporate recent computer  science research at Carnegie Mellon, projects in related technical courses,  and professional case studies.  Sophomores will likely find the course more useful if they have either had an internship or faculty-supervised research, including SURG projects prior to enrollment.",

    "description": "What would an \"intelligent\" picture on the wall do? What if it could see and hear you? What should it say if it could talk? What if your pantry, wardrobe or medicine cabinet could sense, think and act? What should they do and say? What should your cell phone be saying to you? These are not whimsical or theoretical questions...they inevitably arise as ordinary everyday objects around us acquire the ability to sense changes in their environment, think about their implications, and act in pursuit of their goals. These objects are connected to the web and become conduits for services, erasing the distinction between products and services. The ability to invent and build smart products/services is becoming a key skill in the new technology-driven services economy.    The focus of the course will be on building \"ordinary\" objects that can sense, think and act in the real world and on exploring the implications of these capabilities. Students will select their own project and by the end of the semester will create a working prototype that will be exhibited in a public place. Prizes will be offered for the most creative projects. In the course of their projects, students will learn how to use state-of-the-art tools for:    Object detection using video cameras, microphones and other sensors  Movement and gesture detection  Speech recognition and generation    Reasoning and planning:  While the course organizers have many ideas for specific projects, students will be encouraged to design their own projects. Students are expected to work in small groups on their own time and receive faculty advice as needed. There will be weekly meetings of the whole class.",

We will reflect on some issues often taken for granted e.g. are our attitudes to computing generalizable or culturally specific? How are computing and its workforce perceived and represented in US culture and in cultures from around the world? In particular we will be examining how images of the field might affect public attitudes, access to resources and understanding of computer science. Representations of the field take on particular significance in light of recent US government projections: between now and 2018, among all occupations in all fields of science and engineering, computer science occupations will account for nearly 60% of all job growth [Computing Community Consortium, 2010].   This course is aimed primarily at students who are interested in exploring some of the broad issues of computer science and its cultural context. Students will gain experience in teamwork, teaching and presenting. We will use academic papers, web sites, group discussion/debate and popular media. Findings from our investigations will inspire the action component in which student teams develop and implement a public/outreach presentation aimed at re-presenting the exciting field of computer science with broad appeal in mind.",

    "description": "This on-line course gives students an overview of the field of Cloud Computing, its enabling technologies, main building blocks, and hands-on experience through 4 projects utilizing a public cloud (Amazon Web Services). Cloud computing services are being adopted widely across a variety of organizations and in many domains. Simply, cloud computing is the delivery of computing as a service over a network, whereby distributed resources are rented, rather than owned, by an end user as a utility. The course will introduce this domain and cover the topics of data centers, resource management, cloud storage, and programming models. As an introduction, we will discuss the motivating factors, benefits, challenges, and service models. Modern data centers enable many of the economic and technological benefits of the cloud paradigm; hence, we will describe several concepts behind data center design and management. Next, we will focus on existing approaches for resource management including resource abstraction, sharing and virtualization technologies.    Students will learn about different cloud storage concepts including data distribution, durability, consistency and redundancy. HDFS, PVFS, HBase, Cassandra and S3 will be presented as examples of underlying distributed file systems. Students will understand the details of the MapReduce programming model and gain a broad overview of alternative programming models such as Pregel, and GraphLab. Students will work with a public cloud service (such as Amazon Web Services), use it to rent and provision compute resources and then program and deploy applications that run on these resources. Students will work with cloud storage systems and learn to develop applications in the MapReduce programming paradigm.",

We will study modern techniques for computers to represent task-relevant information and make intelligent (i.e. satisficing or optimal) decisions towards the achievement of goals. The search and problem solving methods are applicable throughout a large range of industrial, civil, medical, financial, robotic, and information systems.  We will investigate questions about AI systems such as: how to represent knowledge, how to effectively generate appropriate sequences of actions and how to search among alternatives to find optimal or near-optimal solutions.  We will also explore how to deal with uncertainty in the world, how to learn from experience, and how to learn decision rules from data.  We expect that by the end of the course students will have a thorough understanding of the algorithmic foundations of AI, how probability and AI are closely interrelated, and how automated agents learn.  We also expect students to acquire a strong appreciation of the big-picture aspects of developing fully autonomous intelligent agents.  Other lectures will introduce additional aspects of AI, including natural language processing, web-based search engines, industrial applications, autonomous robotics, and economic/game-theoretic decision making.",

It seeks to understand the computational principles and mechanisms of intelligent behaviors and mental abilities -- such as perception, language, motor control, and learning -- by building artificial systems and computational models with the same capabilities. This course explores how neurons encode and process information, adapt and learn, communicate, cooperate, compete and compute at the individual level as well as at the levels of networks and systems. It will introduce basic concepts in computational modeling, information theory, signal processing, system analysis, statistical and probabilistic inference. Concrete examples will be drawn from the visual system and the motor systems,  and studied from computational, psychological and biological perspectives. Students will learn to perform computational experiments using Matlab and quantitative studies of neurons and neuronal networks.",

The course assumes no background courses in business and is appropriate for those who are interested in bringing innovations to market either through new companies or existing companies.   The course provides an overview of entrepreneurship and innovation, develops an entrepreneurial frame of mind, and provides a framework for learning the rudiments of how to generate ideas.  Students come up with or are presented with potential ideas and learn how to develop these ideas into opportunities, and to explore their potential for becoming viable businesses.  They learn how to do market research, to develop go-to-market strategies, value propositions and to differentiate their products or services from potential competitors.  The focus is on understanding and developing strategies for approaching the key elements of the entrepreneurial process...opportunity, resources and team. The course consists of a balance of lectures, case studies and encounters with entrepreneurs, investors and business professionals.  The students are exposed to financial and intellectual property issues, and encounter a real world perspective on entrepreneurship, innovation and leadership.  The output of the course is a mini-business plan or venture opportunity screening document that can be developed into a business plan in a subsequent course entitled New Venture Creation or through independent study.",

    "description": "Operating System Design and Implementation is a rigorous hands-on introduction to the principles and practice of operating systems. The core experience is writing a small Unix-inspired OS kernel, in C with some x86 assembly language, which runs on a PC hardware simulator (and on actual PC hardware if you wish).  Work is done in two-person teams, and \"team programming\" skills (source control, modularity, documentation) are emphasized.  The size and scope of the programming assignments typically result in students significantly developing their design, implementation, and debugging abilities. Core concepts include the process model, virtual memory, threads, synchronization, and deadlock; the course also surveys higher-level OS topics including file systems, interprocess communication, networking, and security.  Students, especially graduate students, who have not satisfied the prerequisite at Carnegie Mellon are strongly cautioned - to enter the class you must be able to write a storage allocator in C, use a debugger, understand 2's-complement arithmetic, and translate between C and x86 assembly language.  The instructor may require you to complete a skills assessment exercise before the first week of the semester in order to remain registered in the class.  Auditing:  this course is usually full, and we generally receive many more requests to audit than we can accept.  If you wish to audit, please have your advisor contact us before the semester begins to discuss your educational goals.",

Groups of two to four students will select, build, install, and become familiar with an open-source operating system project; propose a significant extension or upgrade to that project; and develop a production-quality implementation meeting the coding standards of that project.  Unless infeasible, the results will be submitted to the project for inclusion in the code base.  Variations on this theme are possible at the discretion of the instructor.  For example, it may be possible to work within the context of a non-operating-system software infrastructure project (window system, web server, or embedded network device kernel) or to extend a 15-410 student kernel.  In some situations students may work alone.  Group membership and unit count (9 units versus 12) will be decided by the third week of the semester.  Contributing to a real-world project will involve engaging in some mixture of messy, potentially open-ended activities such as: learning a revision control system, writing a short design document, creating and updating a simple project plan, participating in an informal code review, synthesizing scattered information about hardware and software, classifying and/or reading large amounts of code written by various people over a long period of time, etc.",

    "description": "In this course, students will carry out a semester-long software\ndevelopment project for a real client.  This course will be part of\nthe Facebook Open Academy Project, providing students an opportunity\nto work with each other and students from other universities to make\nsubstantial contributions to external open source projects.  All\nstudents registered for this course must participate in a kick-off\nmeeting January 30th - February 1st, 2015 in Menlo Park, CA, with\nflight and hotel expenses to be paid by Facebook. At the kickoff\nmeeting you will meet other members of your project team and your open\nsource project mentor, who will provide project-specific guidance for\nthe remainder of the semester.  Students must sign up for the course\nand notify the instructors of their interest by November 21, 2014.\n\nA few lectures at the beginning of the course will introduce the\nprocess, tools, and documents to be used in the course, all of which\nwill be specified by the instructors. Throughout the project, groups\nwill be mentored through weekly team meetings with faculty. Students\nwill make regular presentations, and will be evaluated on the code\ndelivered, software engineering process, client satisfaction, and\ntheir contribution to the team. Students will leave the course with a\nfirsthand understanding of the software engineering realities that\ndrive SE practices. They will have concrete experience with these\npractices, and will have engaged in active reflection on this\nexperience. They will have teamwork, process, and product skills to\nsupport immediate competency in a software engineering organization,\nalong with a deeper understanding that prepares them to evaluate the\nnew processes and techniques they will encounter in the workplace.",

Sound, e.g. speech and music, images, radar and many other signal types that were conventionally considered to be the domain of the Electrical engineer are now also in the domain of computer scientists, who must analyze them, make inferences, and develop machine learning techinques to analyze, classify and reconstruct such data. In this course we will cover the basics of Digital Signal Processing. We will concentrate on the basic mathematical formulations, rather than in-depth implementation details. We will cover the breadth of topics, beginning with the basics of signals and their representations, the theory of sampling, important transform representations, key processing techniques, and spectral estimation.",

    "description": "Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) combine cyber effects (computation and/or communication) with physical effects (motion or other physical processes). Designing algorithms to control CPSs, such as those in cars, aircraft and robots, is challenging due to their tight coupling with physical behavior. At the same time, it is vital that these algorithms be correct, since we rely on CPSs for safety-critical tasks like keeping aircraft from colliding.  Students in this course will understand the core principles behind CPSs, develop models and controls, identify safety specifications and critical properties of CPSs, understand abstraction and system architectures, learn how to design by invariant, reason rigorously about CPS models, verify CPS models of appropriate scale, understand the semantics of a CPS model and develop an intuition for operational effects. Students will write hybrid programs (HPs), which capture relevant dynamical aspects of CPSs in a simple programming language with a simple semantics, allowing the programmer to refer to real-valued variables representing real quantities and specify their dynamics as part of the HP.",

    "description": "The goals of this course are twofold: First, for students to gain an understanding of the principles and techniques behind the design of distributed systems, such as locking, concurrency, scheduling, and communication across the network. Second, for students to gain practical experience designing, implementing, and debugging real distributed systems.  The major themes this course will teach include scarcity, scheduling, concurrency and concurrent programming, naming, abstraction and modularity, imperfect communication and other types of failure, protection from accidental and malicious harm, optimism, and the use of instrumentation and monitoring and debugging tools in problem solving. As the creation and management of software systems is a fundamental goal of any undergraduate systems course, students will design, implement, and debug large programming projects.   As a consequence, competency in both the C and Java programming languages is required.",

To make the issues more concrete, the class includes several multi-week projects requiring significant design and implementation.    The goal is for students to learn not only what computer networks are and how they work today, but also why they are designed the way they are and how they are likely to evolve in the future. We will draw examples primarily from the Internet. Topics to be covered include: network architecture, routing, congestion/flow/error control, naming and addressing,  peer-to-peer and the web, internetworking, and network security.",

In a standard algorithms course, one concentrates on giving resource efficient methods to solve interesting problems. In this course, we concentrate on techniques that prove or suggest that there are no efficient methods to solve many important problems.  We will develop the theory of various complexity classes, such as P, NP, co-NP, PH, #P, PSPACE, NC, AC, L, NL, UP, RP, BPP, IP, and PCP. We will study techniques to classify problems according to our available taxonomy. By developing a subtle pattern of reductions between classes we will suggest an (as yet unproven!) picture of how by using limited amounts of various resources, we limit our computational power.",

    "description": "Computational Photography is an emerging new field created by the  convergence of computer graphics, computer vision and  photography. Its role is to overcome the limitations of the  traditional camera by using computational techniques to produce a  richer, more vivid, perhaps more perceptually meaningful  representation of our visual world.    The aim of this advanced undergraduate course is to study ways in  which samples from the real world (images and video) can be used to  generate compelling computer graphics imagery. We will learn how to  acquire, represent, and render scenes from digitized photographs.  Several popular image-based algorithms will be presented, with an  emphasis on using these techniques to build practical systems. This  hands-on emphasis will be reflected in the programming assignments, in  which students will have the opportunity to acquire their own images  of indoor and outdoor scenes and develop the image analysis and  synthesis tools needed to render and view the scenes on the computer.",

In particular, a large emphasis will be on game AI. The class will also cover such topics as game networking, scheduling of tasks in computationally intensive games, and game design. The class will also briefly cover few selected topics such as collision detection and physically-based animation that are good to know even if one is developing games using a game engine. The second goal of the class is to get students familiar with programming games on various platforms using state-of-the-art game engines. To this end, the course will have a heavy programming focus. It will have a number of projects requiring students to apply the learned material to develop games using Unity 3D game engine. The students will develop games that run on a standalone PC, games that run on an Android platform and games that work in a multi-user mode.  In addition to learning the material and learning how to use game engines, the projects will provide students with portfolios of games they have developed. Such a portfolio is important in getting a job in game industry.    Prerequisite is 15-462 or contact the instructor for permission.",

    "description": "Creating intelligent robots can be viewed as the integration of many  pieces - \"bits\" - \"RoboBits\". This course will teach students such  \"RoboBits\" for creating both single and groups of intelligent  robots, with perception, cognition, and action. Students in the  course work with real functional mobile robots, equipped with RGB  and RGB+D cameras, different types of actuation, namely wheeled and  legged robots, and computation onboard. Students learn effective  vision processing algorithms for object recognition, motion modeling  and planning, robot localization and planning algorithms, and  multi-robot communication for shared sensing and teamwork.  We will  further study cognitive architectures, learning, and human-robot  interaction. 15-491 is a PROJECT-BASED course, which runs in the  CORAL research lab in GHC 3201. The course has three major projects  with specific tasks that incrementally lead to the research and  development of complete intelligent robots. The projects are  decomposed in weekly tasks. The class meets twice a week, and the  students have access to the lab for further work as needed.  Evaluation is based on class participation, weekly progress, and  project reports, presentations, and outcomes.",

    "description": "Cognitive robotics is a new approach to robot programming based on    high level primitives for perception and action. These primitives draw    inspiration from ideas in cognitive science combined with state of the    art robotics algorithms. Students will experiment with these    primitives and help develop new ones using the Tekkotsu software    framework on the Calliope robot, which includes a 5 degree-of-freedom    arm with gripper, a Kinect camera on a pan/tilt mount, and Ubuntu    Linux on a dual-core on-board netbook. Prior robotics experience is    not necessary, but strong programming skills are required.",

    "description": "This class covers the fundamentals of information forensics: analyzing   storage devices and system, network systems, mobile devices and   conventional computers, appliances such as copiers and faxes, and game   systems. It includes necesary coverage of the technical details of the   systems to be analyzed as well as the tools and techniques used to   analyze them. The class covers threats to the integrity of information,   spoilage, and assessing the fidelity of apparent discoveries. Students   will learn proper forensic techniques and protocols, as well as how to   document findings and opinions in reports and how to offer live testimony.    Students will also learn to consider the impact of information and its   security on society and the impact of the availability of information on   privacy. Students will serve as a resource for local and federal public   defenders and investigators assisting indigent clients working on real,   live cases that affect real defendants and real communities. In this   capacity students will be advancing the cause of justice by helping to   uncover the facts surrounding the case.    The course will also include presentations from federal and state   prosecutors, defenders, and investigators about the criminal justice   system, information forensics in the real world, law and technology, and   the future of technology, the law, justice, security, and privacy.",

The course begins with an introduction to how computing technology can have a positive impact on the lives of people in developing communities and people with disabilities. Next, students will learn about the components of field research including needs assessment, literature review, iterative solution development, evaluation, and dissemination. Students will also explore the challenges of field research in this area and learn effective strategies for overcoming these challenges. Overall, students will engage in assignments and in-class exercises that help them gain experience and prepare for future field research endeavors. As part of the final assignment, students will participate in a solution design process for a specific challenge faced by one of the underserved community partners of the TechBridgeWorld research group at Carnegie Mellon University. This year, the course will focus on innovating technology tools for visually impaired people related to smart cities of the future. Promising outcomes of this course will be further developed by the TechBridgeWorld research group and tested with visually impaired users with the permission of students involved with producing these outcomes.",

    "description": "Operating System Design and Implementation is a rigorous hands-on introduction to the principles and practice of operating systems.  The core experience is writing a small Unix-inspired OS kernel, in C with some x86 assembly language, which runs on a PC hardware  simulator (and on actual PC hardware if you wish).  Work is done in two-person teams, and \"team programming\" skills (source control,  modularity, documentation) are emphasized.  The size and scope of the programming assignments typically result in students significantly developing their design, implementation, and debugging abilities. Core concepts include the process model, virtual memory, threads, synchronization, and deadlock; the course also surveys higher-level OS topics including file systems, interprocess communication, networking, and security.    Students, especially graduate students, who have not satisfied the prerequisite at  Carnegie Mellon are strongly cautioned - to enter the class you must be able  to write a storage allocator in C, use a debugger, understand 2's-complement  arithmetic, and translate between C and x86 assembly language.  The  instructor may require you to complete a skills assessment exercise before  the first week of the semester in order to remain registered in the class.    Auditing:  this course is usually full, and we generally receive  many more requests to audit than we can accept.  If you wish to  audit, please have your advisor contact us before the semester  begins to discuss your educational goals.",

    "description": "The goal of this class is for students to acquire hands-on experience  with operating-system code as it is developed and deployed in the  real world.  Groups of two to four students will select, build,  install, and become familiar with an open-source operating system  project; propose a significant extension or upgrade to that project;  and develop a production-quality implementation meeting the coding  standards of that project.  Unless infeasible, the results will be  submitted to the project for inclusion in the code base.    Variations on this theme are possible at the discretion of the  instructor.  For example, it may be possible to work within the  context of a non-operating-system software infrastructure project  (window system, web server, or embedded network device kernel) or  to extend a 15-410 student kernel.  In some situations students  may work alone.  Group membership and unit count (9 units versus  12) will be decided by the third week of the semester.    Contributing to a real-world project will involve engaging  in some mixture of messy, potentially open-ended activities  such as: learning a revision control system, writing a  short design document, creating and updating a simple project  plan, participating in an informal code review, synthesizing  scattered information about hardware and software, classifying  and/or reading large amounts of code written by various people  over a long period of time, etc.",

    "description": "This on-line course gives students an overview of the field of Cloud Computing, its enabling technologies, main building blocks, and hands-on experience through 4 projects utilizing a public cloud (Amazon Web Services). Cloud computing services are being adopted widely across a variety of organizations and in many domains. Simply, cloud computing is the delivery of computing as a service over a network, whereby distributed resources are rented, rather than owned, by an end user as a utility. The course will introduce this domain and cover the topics of data centers, resource management, cloud storage, and programming models. As an introduction, we will discuss the motivating factors, benefits, challenges, and service models. Modern data centers enable many of the economic and technological benefits of the cloud paradigm; hence, we will describe several concepts behind data center design and management. Next, we will focus on existing approaches for resource management including resource abstraction, sharing and virtualization technologies. Students will learn about different cloud storage concepts including data distribution, durability, consistency and redundancy. HDFS, PVFS, HBase, Cassandra and S3 will be presented as examples of underlying distributed file systems. Students will understand the details of the MapReduce programming model and gain a broad overview of alternative programming models such as Pregel, and GraphLab. Students will work with a public cloud service (such as Amazon Web Services), use it to rent and provision compute resources and then program and deploy applications that run on these resources. Students will work with cloud storage systems and learn to develop applications in the MapReduce programming paradigm.",

Sound, e.g. speech and music, images, radar and many other signal types that were conventionally considered to be the domain of the Electrical engineer are now also in the domain of computer scientists, who must analyze them, make inferences, and develop machine learning techinques to analyze, classify and reconstruct such data. In this course we will cover the basics of Digital Signal Processing. We will concentrate on the basic mathematical formulations, rather than in-depth implementation details. We will cover the breadth of topics, beginning with the basics of signals and their representations, the theory of sampling, important transform representations, key processing techniques, and spectral estimation.",

    "description": "Cyber-physical systems (CPSs) combine cyber effects (computation and/or communication) with physical effects (motion or other physical processes). Designing algorithms to control CPSs, such as those in cars, aircraft and robots, is challenging due to their tight coupling with physical behavior. At the same time, it is vital that these algorithms be correct, since we rely on CPSs for safety-critical tasks like keeping aircraft from colliding.  Students in this course will understand the core principles behind CPSs, develop models and controls, identify safety specifications and critical properties of CPSs, understand abstraction and system architectures, learn how to design by invariant, reason rigorously about CPS models, verify CPS models of appropriate scale, understand the semantics of a CPS model and develop an intuition for operational effects. Students will write hybrid programs (HPs), which capture relevant dynamical aspects of CPSs in a simple programming language with a simple semantics, allowing the programmer to refer to real-valued variables representing real quantities and specify their dynamics as part of the HP.",

Second, for students to gain practical experience designing, implementing, and debugging real distributed systems.  The major themes this course will teach include scarcity, scheduling, concurrency and concurrent programming, naming, abstraction and modularity, imperfect communication and other types of failure, protection from accidental and malicious harm, optimism, and the use of instrumentation and monitoring and debugging tools in problem solving. As the creation and management of software systems is a fundamental goal of any undergraduate systems course, students will design, implement, and debug large programming projects.   As a consequence, competency in both the C and Java programming languages is required.",

Without good hands on experience with the current systems and their tools, theoretical knowledge leads to theoretical success, and too often little more.

Efficient data structures will be discussed to support these algorithmic concepts. Topics include: Run time analysis, divide-and-conquer algorithms, dynamic programming algorithms, network flow algorithms, linear and integer programming, large-scale search algorithms and heuristics, efficient data storage and query, and NP-completeness. Although this course will have several programming assignments, it is primarily not a programming course. Instead, it will focus on the design and analysis of algorithms for general classes of problems. This course is not open to CS graduate students who should consider taking 15-651 instead.",

Formal approaches to defining the syntax and semantics are used to describe the fundamental concepts underlying programming languages. A variety of programming paradigms are covered such as imperative, functional, logic, and concurrent programming. In addition to the formal studies, experience with programming in the languages is used to illustrate how different design goals can lead to radically different languages and models of computation.",

In areas such as artificial intelligence and computer science theory, probabilistic methods and ideas based on randomization are central. In other areas such as networks and systems, probability is becoming an increasingly useful framework for handling uncertainty and modeling the patterns of data that occur in complex systems.  This course gives an introduction to probability as it is used in computer science theory and practice, drawing on applications and current research developments as motivation and context. Topics include combinatorial probability and random graphs, heavy tail distributions, concentration inequalities, various randomized algorithms, sampling random variables and computer simulation, and Markov chains and their many applications, from Web search engines to models of network protocols. The course will assume familiarity with 3-D calculus and linear algebra.",

    "description": "Computational Photography is an emerging new field created by the  convergence of computer graphics, computer vision and  photography. Its role is to overcome the limitations of the  traditional camera by using computational techniques to produce a  richer, more vivid, perhaps more perceptually meaningful  representation of our visual world.    The aim of this advanced undergraduate course is to study ways in  which samples from the real world (images and video) can be used to  generate compelling computer graphics imagery. We will learn how to  acquire, represent, and render scenes from digitized photographs.  Several popular image-based algorithms will be presented, with an  emphasis on using these techniques to build practical systems. This  hands-on emphasis will be reflected in the programming assignments, in  which students will have the opportunity to acquire their own images  of indoor and outdoor scenes and develop the image analysis and  synthesis tools needed to render and view the scenes on the computer.",

    "description": "The goal of the course is two-fold. The first goal is to teach students   some of the higher-level techniques that are necessary to implement   interesting computer games. In particular, a large emphasis will be on   game AI. The class will also cover such topics as game networking,   scheduling of tasks in computationally intensive games, and game design.   The class will also briefly cover few selected topics such as collision   detection and physically-based animation that are good to know even if one   is developing games using a game engine. The second goal of the class is   to get students familiar with programming games on various platforms using   state-of-the-art game engines. To this end, the course will have a heavy   programming focus. It will have a number of projects requiring students to   apply the learned material to develop games using Unity 3D game engine.   The students will develop games that run on a standalone PC, games that   run on an Android platform and games that work in a multi-user mode.  In addition to learning the material and learning how to use game engines,   the projects will provide students with portfolios of games they have   developed. Such a portfolio is important in getting a job in game   industry.    PREREQUISITE: 15-462, or contact the instructor for permission",

It seeks to understand the computational principles and mechanisms of intelligent behaviors and mental abilities -- such as perception, language, motor control, and learning -- by building artificial systems and computational models with the same capabilities. This course explores how neurons encode and process information, adapt and learn, communicate, cooperate, compete and compute at the individual level as well as at the levels of networks and systems. It will introduce basic concepts in computational modeling, information theory, signal processing, system analysis, statistical and probabilistic inference. Concrete examples will be drawn from the visual system and the motor systems,  and studied from computational, psychological and biological perspectives. Students will learn to perform computational experiments using Matlab and quantitative studies of neurons and neuronal networks.",

    "description": "Storage systems are among the most fascinating and the most important parts of computer systems. They often dominate the performance of a system, and their components' inner workings require amazing feats of engineering. At the same time, storage systems hold the crown jewels of most organizations: their information (from source code to Microsoft's software to the sales databases of every e-commerce site). Within the field of computer systems and computer engineering, there is no area whose demand for bright people and better solutions is more robust.   This course will cover the design, implementation, and use of storage systems, from the characteristics and operation of individual storage devices to the OS, database, and networking approaches involved in tying them together and making them useful. Along the way, we will examine several case studies of real systems, demands placed on storage systems by important applications, and impacts of trends and emerging technologies on future storage systems.   For those familiar with 18-316 (Intro. to Data Storage Systems Technology) and 18-517 (Data Storage Systems Design Project): one should consider these courses as distinct and complementary, with neither being a pre-requisite to the other. 18-316 and 18-517 focus on the low-level technologies (magnetics, materials, applied physics, etc.) whereas 746 focuses on storage's incorporation and role in computer systems.

    "description": "CLASSES WILL NOT BEGIN UNTIL THE WEEK OF SEPTEMBER 9TH  Description:  This is an introductory course on the foundations of programming languages. The central organizing principle of language design is the identification of language features with types. The theory of programming languages, therefore, reduces to the theory of types. Type theory is a comprehensive foundational theory of computation. Type theory has its orgins in proof theory (the theory of human reason) and is closely related to category theory (the general theory of mathematical structures). The tripartite relationship between type theory, proof theory, and category theory is fundamental to the study of programming languages. We will place special emphasis on the propositions-as-types correspondence, in which programs of a type are identified with proofs of the corresponding proposition. (Similar correspondences hold between type theory and category theory (types are objects, programs are maps) and between category theory and proof theory (propositions are objects, proofs are maps), but we shall not consider these in this course.)

    "description": "This is a course exploring research issues in the emerging fields of mobile computing and its close relative, pervasive computing. Many traditional areas of computer science and computer engineering are impacted by the constraints and demands of mobile and pervasive computing. Examples include network protocols, power management, user interfaces, file access, usability and security. This will be an \"advanced\" course in the truest sense --- most, if not all, the topics discussed will be ones where there is little consensus in the research community on the best approaches. The course will also offer significant \"hand-on\" experience in this area.   Each student will have to present and lead the discussion on a number of papers. Students will work in groups of three under the guidance of a mentor on a hands-on project. Each student will also be required to write one of two documents based on an idea in mobile and pervasive computing: (a) a research proposal (similar in spirit to an NSF proposal) or (b) a short business plan for a commercial opportunity. Grading will be based on the quality of the presentations, the project, the proposal or business plan, and brief in-class quizzes on the readings.

    "description": "Classes will not begin until the week of September 8th. Please refer to https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~csd-grad/courseschedulef14.html for the most recent schedule updates. Description: In designing computer systems one is usually constrained by certain performance requirements and limitations. For example, one might need to guarantee a response time SLA or certain throughput requirement, while at the same time staying within a power budget or cost budget. On the other hand, one often has many choices: One fast disk, or two slow ones? More memory, or a faster processor? A fair scheduler or one that minimizes mean response time? For multi-server systems, one can choose from a wide array of load balancing policies, a wide array of migration policies, capacity provisioning schemes, power management policies ... The possibilities are endless. The best choices are often counter-intuitive. Ideally, one would like to have answers to these questions before investing the time and money to build a system. This class will introduce students to analytic stochastic modeling with the aim of answering the above questions.    Students should have a strong background in probability before embarking on this class.   If you are worried about your probability background, please work through all the examples and exercises in Chpt 3 of the class textbook.",

    "description": "Please refer to this link for the most recent schedule updates. Summary: Planning is ubiquitous in everyday life -- from planning how to make dinner to planning how to graduate from University with the least amount of work. Researchers in AI have studied planning problems for many years, and many techniques exist for automating planning processes. This course will explore both classical and modern approaches to planning. Issues to be discussed include: how to represent actions and world state, how to search for plans efficiently, how to deal with uncertainty in actions and the world state, how to find \"good\" or \"optimal\" plans,how to represent time, and how to dynamically combine planning and execution. Specific planning techniques to be covered include: means-ends analysis, linear and non-linear planning, partial-order planning, graph-based planning, heuristic planning, BBD-based planning, hierarchical planning, temporal planning, conditional and conformant planning, probabilistic planning and learning using Markov models (MDPs and POMDPs), integration of planning, perception and execution, execution monitoring and replanning, path planning, multi-agent planning, and scheduling. There are no explicit prerequisites, but a basic knowledge of AI is assumed.",
