    "description": "Provides a practical introduction to programming for students with little or no prior programming experience. Extensive programming assignments will illustrate programming concepts, languages, and tools. Programming assignments will be based on analytical tasks that might be faced by scientists and will typically include parsing, statistical analysis, simulation, and optimization. Principles of good software engineering will also be stressed. Most programming assignments will be done in the Go programming language, an industry-supported, modern programming language, the syntax of which will be covered in depth. Several other assignments will be given in Python, Java, and C++ to highlight the commonalities and differences between languages. No prior programming experience is assumed, and no biology background is needed. Analytical skills and mathematical maturity are required.",

    "description": "Do you want to know how to discover the tendencies hidden in your genome? Since the first draft of a human genome sequence became available about a decade ago, the cost of genome sequencing has decreased dramatically. Personal genome sequencing will likely become a routine part of medical exams for patients for prognostic and diagnostic purposes. Personal genome information will also play an increasing role in lifestyle choices, as people take into account their own genetic tendencies. Commercial services such as 23andMe have already taken first steps in this direction. Computational methods for mining large-scale genome data are being developed to unravel the genetic basis of diseases and assist doctors in clinics.  This course introduces students to biological, computational, and ethical issues concerning use of personal genome information in health maintenance, medical practice, biomedical research, and policymaking. We focus on practical issues, using individual genome sequences (such as that of Nobel prize winner James Watson) and other population-level genome data. Without requiring any background in biology or CS, we begin with an overview of topics from genetics, molecular biology, stats, and machine learning relevant to the modern personal genome era. We then cover scientific issues such as how to discover your genetic ancestry and how to learn from genomes about migration and evolution of human populations. We discuss medical aspects such as how to predict whether you will develop diseases such as diabetes based on your own genome, how to discover disease-causing genetic mutations, and how genetic information can be used to recommend clinical treatments.

    "description": "This is a 12-unit class intended to provide a general introduction to computational tools for biology. The course is divided into two modules, which may be taken individually as courses 03-251/02-251 and 03-252/02-252. Module 1 covers computational molecular biology/genomics. It examines important sources of biological data, how they are archived and made available to researchers, and what computational tools are available to use them effectively in research. In the process, it covers basic concepts in statistics, mathematics, and computer science needed to effectively use these resources and understand their results. Specific topics covered include sequence data, searching and alignment, structural data, genome sequencing, genome analysis, genetic variation, gene and protein expression, and biological networks and pathways. Module 2 covers computational cell biology, including biological modeling and image analysis. It includes homeworks requiring use or modification of Matlab scripts. The modeling component includes computer models of population dynamics, biochemical kinetics, cell pathways, neuron behavior, and stochastic simulations. The imaging component includes basics of machine visions, morphological image analysis, image classification and image-derived models. This course is intended primarily for biological sciences or biomedical engineering majors at the undergraduate or graduate level who have had little or no prior experience with computer science or programming.

    "description": "This is an introductory laboratory-based course designed to teach basic biological laboratory skills used in exploring the quantitative nature of biological systems and the reasoning required for performing research in computational biology. Over the course of the semester, students will perform many experiments and quantitatively analyze the results of these experiments. Students will also have the opportunity to design experiments based on the data they collect. During this course students will be using traditional, well-developed techniques to answer open questions. What microbes are found in the food we eat? What changes do cells undergo during apoptosis? Understanding the results of these experiments will require students to think critically about the results they generate, the appropriate controls required to confirm results, and the biological context within which these results were obtained. During this course students will gain experience in many aspects of scientific research, including: Sequencing and analyzing a large and diverse population of DNA, Designing and performing PCR for a variety of analyses, Maintaining cell cultures, Taking brightfield and fluorescent microscopy images, Developing methods for automated analysis of cell images, Communicating results to peers and colleagues.  As space is limited, laboratory sections will be small. Additional sections will be added to accommodate all students on the waitlist.

    "description": "Biology is increasingly becoming a \"big data\" science, as biomedical research has been revolutionized by automated methods for generating large amounts of data on diverse biological processes.  Integration of data from many types of experiments is required to construct detailed, predictive models of cell, tissue or organism behaviors, and the complexity of the systems suggests that need for these models to be constructed automatically. This requires iterative cycles of acquisition, analysis, modeling, and experimental design, since it is not feasible to do all possible biological experiments. This course will cover a range of automated biological research methods (especially high-throughput, robotic methods for protein structure determination, gene sequencing, cell-based drug screening, and nanoassays), and a range of computational methods for automating the acquisition and interpretation of the data (especially active learning, proactive learning, compressed sensing and model structure learning).  Class sessions will consist of a combination of lectures and discussions of important research papers. Grading will be based on class participation, homeworks, and a final project.    Prerequisites: 15-122 or instructor permission.",

Topics covered include kinetic and equilibrium descriptions of biological processes, systematic approaches to model building and parameter estimation, analysis of biochemical circuits modeled as differential equations, modeling the effects of noise using stochastic methods, modeling spatial effects, and modeling at higher levels of abstraction or scale using logical or agent-based approaches. A range of biological models and applications will be considered including gene regulatory networks, cell signaling, and cell cycle regulation. Weekly lab sessions will provide students hands-on experience with methods and models presented in class. Course requirements include regular class participation, bi-weekly homework assignments, a take-home exam, and a final project.    Prerequisites: The course is designed for graduate and upper-level undergraduate students with a wide variety of backgrounds.  The course is intended to be self-contained but students may need to do some additional work to gain fluency in core concepts.  Students should have a basic knowledge of calculus, differential equations, and chemistry as well as some previous exposure to molecular biology and biochemistry.  Experience with programming and numerical computation is useful but not mandatory.

    "description": "Provides a practical introduction to programming for students with little or no prior programming experience. Extensive programming assignments will illustrate programming concepts, languages, and tools. Programming assignments will be based on analytical tasks that might be faced by scientists and will typically include parsing, statistical analysis, simulation, and optimization. Principles of good software engineering will also be stressed. Most programming assignments will be done in the Go programming language, an industry-supported, modern programming language, the syntax of which will be covered in depth. Several other assignments will be given in Python, Java, and C++ to highlight the commonalities and differences between languages. No prior programming experience is assumed, and no biology background is needed. Analytical skills and mathematical maturity are required.",

Efficient data structures will be discussed to support these algorithmic concepts. Topics include: Run time analysis, divide-and-conquer algorithms, dynamic programming algorithms, network flow algorithms, linear and integer programming, large-scale search algorithms and heuristics, efficient data storage and query, and NP-completeness. Although this course will have several programming assignments, it is primarily not a programming course. Instead, it will focus on the design and analysis of algorithms for general classes of problems. This course is not open to CS graduate students who should consider taking 15-651 instead.",

    "description": "The goal of this course is to examine cases where basic research on cognitive science, including cognitive neuroscience, has made its way into application, in order to understand how science gets applied more generally.  The course focuses on applications that are sufficiently advanced as to have made an impact outside of the research field per se; for example, as a product,  a change in practice, or a legal statute.  Examples are virtual reality (in vision, hearing, and touch), cognitive tutors, phonologically based reading programs, latent semantic analysis applications to writing assessment, and measures of consumers' implicit attitudes.     The course will use a case-study approach that considers a set of applications in detail, while building a general understanding of what it means to move research into the applied setting.  The questions to be considered include:  What makes a body of theoretically based research applicable?  What is the pathway from laboratory to practice?  What are the barriers - economic, legal, entrenched belief or practice?     The format will emphasize analysis and discussion by students.  They should bring to the course an interest in application; extensive prior experience in cognitive science is not necessary.  The course will include tutorials on basic topics in cognitive science such as perception, memory, and spatial cognition.  These should provide sufficient grounding to discuss the applications.",

    "description": "Online learning has become widespread (e.g., MOOCs, online and blended courses, and Khan Academy) and many claim it will revolutionize higher education and K-12. How can we make sure online learning is maximally effective? Learners differ along many dimensions and they change over time. Therefore, advanced learning technologies must adapt to learners to provide individualized learning experiences.  This course covers a number of proven personalization techniques used in advanced learning technologies. One of the techniques is the use of cognitive modeling to personalize practice of complex cognitive skills in intelligent tutoring systems. This approach, developed at CMU, may well be the most significant application of cognitive science in education and is commercially successful. We will also survey newer techniques, such as personalizing based on student meta-cognition, affect, and motivation. Finally, we will look at personalization approaches that are widely believed to be effective but have not proven to be so.  The course involves readings and discussion of different ways of personalizing instruction, with an emphasis on cognitive modeling approaches. Students will learn to use the Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools (CTAT, http://ctat.pact.cs.cmu.edu) to implement tutor prototypes that rely on computer-executable models of human problem solving to personalize instruction.  The course is meant for graduate or advanced undergraduate students in Human-Computer Interaction, Psychology, Computer Science, Design, or related fields, who are interested in educational applications. Students should either have some  programming skills or experience in the cognitive psychology of human problem solving, or experience with instructional design.",

    "description": "Machine Learning is concerned with computer programs that enable the behavior of a computer to be learned from examples or experience rather than dictated through rules written by hand. It has practical value in many application areas of computer science such as on-line communities and digital libraries. This class is meant to teach the practical side of machine learning for applications, such as mining newsgroup data or building adaptive user interfaces. The emphasis will be on learning the process of applying machine learning effectively to a variety of problems rather than emphasizing an understanding of the theory behind what makes machine learning work. This course does not assume any prior exposure to machine learning theory or practice. In the first 2/3 of the course, we will cover a wide range of learning algorithms that can be applied to a variety of problems. In particular, we will cover topics such as decision trees, rule based classification, support vector machines, Bayesian networks, and clustering. In the final third of the class, we will go into more depth on one application area, namely the application of machine learning to problems involving text processing, such as information retrieval or text categorization.",

    "description": "There is growing recognition that technology alone will not provide all of the solutions to security and privacy problems. Human factors play an important role in these areas, and it is important for security and privacy experts to have an understanding of how people will interact with the systems they develop. This course is designed to introduce students to a variety of usability and user interface problems related to privacy and security and to give them experience in designing studies aimed at helping to evaluate usability issues in security and privacy systems. The course is suitable both for students interested in privacy and security who would like to learn more about usability, as well as for students interested in usability who would like to learn more about security and privacy. Much of the course will be taught in a graduate seminar style in which all students will be expected to do a weekly reading assignment and each week different students will prepare a presentation for the class. Students will also work on a group project throughout the semester. The course is open to all graduate students who have technical backgrounds. The 12-unit course numbers (08-734 and 5-836) are for PhD students and masters students. Students enrolled in these course numbers will be expected to play a leadership role in a group project that produces a paper suitable for publication.  The 9-unit 500-level course numbers (08-534 and 05-436) are for juniors, seniors, and masters students. Students enrolled in these course numbers will  have less demanding project and presentation requirements.",

    "description": "This is a programming course and design studio, and is for those who want to express their interactive ideas in working prototypes. Students will learn how to use programming languages, how to design and implement effective GUIs, and how to perform user tests. We will cover several prototyping tools and require prototypes to be constructed in each, ranging from animated mock-ups to fully functional programs. The course will also cover usability testing of interactive prototypes. Assignments will require implementing UIs, testing that interface with users, and then modifying the interface based on your findings. Some class sessions will feature design reviews where students present their findings and modifications based on user tests.    This course is for HCII Masters students with a minimal programming background, and for HCI undergrads who have had an introductory programming course. Students taking this course will often not be professional programmers, but will probably need to interact with programmers, and need to:     * Learn to express yourself in executable form     * Learn the basics of what is hard and easy to rapidly prototype     * Learn the basic terminology and approaches used by programmers     * Experience the frustration and joy of programming a working prototype     * Design and conduct informal user tests    PREREQUISITES:  Proficiency in a programming language, program structure, algorithm analysis, and data abstraction. Normally met through an introductory programming course using C, C++, Pascal or Java, such as 15100, 15112, 15127 or equivalent. Pragmatically, students entering this course should be able to independently and successfully write a 300-line program in a 48 hour period.",

    "description": "Machine Learning is concerned with computer programs that enable the behavior of a computer to be learned from examples or experience rather than dictated through rules written by hand.  It has practical value in many application areas of computer science such as on-line communities and digital libraries.  This class is meant to teach the practical side of machine learning for applications, such as mining newsgroup data or building adaptive user interfaces.  The emphasis will be on learning the process of applying machine learning effectively to a variety of problems rather than emphasizing an understanding of the theory behind what makes machine learning work.  This course does not assume any prior exposure to machine learning theory or practice. In the first 2/3 of the course, we will cover a wide range of learning algorithms that can be applied to a variety of problems.  In particular, we will cover topics such as decision trees, rule based classification, support vector machines, Bayesian networks, and clustering. In the final third of the class, we will go into more depth on one application area, namely the application of machine learning to problems involving text processing, such as information retrieval or text categorization.",

    "description": "This course will introduce students to the highly interdisciplinary area of Artificial Intelligence known alternately as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Linguistics. The course aims to cover the techniques used today in software that does useful things with text in human languages like English and Chinese. Applications of NLP include automatic translation between languages, extraction and summarization of information in documents, question answering and dialog systems, and conversational agents. This course will focus on core representations and algorithms, with some time spent on real-world applications. Because modern NLP relies so heavily on Machine Learning, we'll cover the basics of discrete classification and probabilistic modeling as we go. Good computational linguists also know about Linguistics, so topics in linguistics (phonology, morphology, and syntax) will be covered when fitting. From a software engineering perspective, there will be an emphasis on rapid prototyping, a useful skill in many other areas of Computer Science. In particular, we will introduce some high-level languages (e.g., regular expressions and Dyna) and some scripting languages (e.g., Python and Perl) that can greatly simplify prototype implementation.",

    "description": "Machine Learning is concerned with computer programs that enable the behavior of a computer to be learned from examples or experience rather than dictated through rules written by hand.  It has practical value in many application areas of computer science such as on-line communities and digital libraries.  This class is meant to teach the practical side of machine learning for applications, such as mining newsgroup data or building adaptive user interfaces.  The emphasis will be on learning the process of applying machine learning effectively to a variety of problems rather than emphasizing an understanding of the theory behind what makes machine learning work.  This course does not assume any prior exposure to machine learning theory or practice. In the first 2/3 of the course, we will cover a wide range of learning algorithms that can be applied to a variety of problems.  In particular, we will cover topics such as decision trees, rule based classification, support vector machines, Bayesian networks, and clustering. In the final third of the class, we will go into more depth on one application area, namely the application of machine learning to problems involving text processing, such as information retrieval or text categorization.",

    "description": "A technical introduction to the fundamentals of programming with an emphasis  on producing clear, robust, and reasonably efficient code using top-down  design, informal analysis, and effective testing and debugging. Starting  from first principles, we will cover a large subset of the Python  programming language, including its standard libraries and programming  paradigms.  We will also target numerous deployment scenarios, including  standalone programs, shell scripts, and web-based applications.  This course assumes no prior programming experience. Even so, it is a  fast-paced and rigorous preparation for 15-122.  Students seeking a more  gentle introduction to computer science should consider first taking 15-110.    NOTE: students must achieve a C or better in order to use   this course to satisfy the pre-requisite for any subsequent Computer   Science course.",

Teaches imperative programming and methods for ensuring the correctness of programs.  Students will learn the process and concepts needed to go from high-level descriptions of algorithms to correct imperative implementations, with specific application to basic data structures and algorithms.  Much of the course will be conducted in a subset of C amenable to verification, with a transition to full C near the end. This course prepares students for 15-213 and 15-210.  NOTE: students must achieve a C or better in order to use  this course to satisfy the pre-requisite for any subsequent Computer  Science course.",

    "description": "An introduction to programming based on a \"functional\" model of computation.  The functional model is a natural generalization of algebra in which programs are formulas that describe the output of a computation in terms of its inputs---that is, as a function.  But instead of being confined to real- or complex-valued functions, the functional model extends the algebraic view to a very rich class of data types, including not only aggregates built up from other types, but also functions themselves as values.  This course is an introduction to programming that is focused on the central concepts of function and type.  One major theme is the interplay between inductive types, which are built up incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function.  Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules, and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation.    NOTE: students must achieve a C or better in order to use   this course to satisfy the pre-requisite for any subsequent Computer   Science course.",

This course has the purpose of introducing first-year Computer Science students to elements of formal logic as well as to the historical context in which this discipline developed. As all subsequent courses in the CS curriculum rely on students having mastered basic logical notions and skills, it will test and enhance your preparation, thereby putting you in a better position to succeed in the program. It will also help you understand and appreciate how CS came about since Computer Science grew out of logic. The specific knowledge and skills you will learn in is course include: an enhanced ability to research topics, give presentations and write technical prose, some elementary logic, some historical depth into Computer Science, mathematics and logic itself. This course is open to Computer Science freshmen only.",

    "description": "Software engineers today are less likely to design data structures and algorithms from scratch and more likely to build systems from library and framework components. In this course, students engage with concepts related to the construction of software systems at scale, building on their understanding of the basic building blocks of data structures, algorithms, program structures, and computer structures. The course covers technical topics in four areas: (1) concepts of design for complex systems, (2) object oriented programming, (3) static and dynamic analysis for programs, and (4) concurrent and distributed software. Student assignments involve engagement with complex software such as distributed massively multi-player game systems and frameworks for graphical user interaction.",

    "description": "Complexity theory is the study of how much of a resource (such as time, space, parallelism, or randomness) is required to perform some of the computations that interest us the most. In a standard algorithms course, one concentrates on giving resource efficient methods to solve interesting problems. In this course, we concentrate on techniques that prove or suggest that there are no efficient methods to solve many important problems.  We will develop the theory of various complexity classes, such as P, NP, co-NP, PH, #P, PSPACE, NC, AC, L, NL, UP, RP, BPP, IP, and PCP. We will study techniques to classify problems according to our available taxonomy. By developing a subtle pattern of reductions between classes we will suggest an (as yet unproven!) picture of how by using limited amounts of various resources, we limit our computational power.",

    "description": "Computational Photography is an emerging new field created by the  convergence of computer graphics, computer vision and  photography. Its role is to overcome the limitations of the  traditional camera by using computational techniques to produce a  richer, more vivid, perhaps more perceptually meaningful  representation of our visual world.    The aim of this advanced undergraduate course is to study ways in  which samples from the real world (images and video) can be used to  generate compelling computer graphics imagery. We will learn how to  acquire, represent, and render scenes from digitized photographs.  Several popular image-based algorithms will be presented, with an  emphasis on using these techniques to build practical systems. This  hands-on emphasis will be reflected in the programming assignments, in  which students will have the opportunity to acquire their own images  of indoor and outdoor scenes and develop the image analysis and  synthesis tools needed to render and view the scenes on the computer.",

    "description": "The goal of the course is two-fold. The first goal is to teach students some of the higher-level techniques that are necessary to implement interesting computer games. In particular, a large emphasis will be on game AI. The class will also cover such topics as game networking, scheduling of tasks in computationally intensive games, and game design. The class will also briefly cover few selected topics such as collision detection and physically-based animation that are good to know even if one is developing games using a game engine. The second goal of the class is to get students familiar with programming games on various platforms using state-of-the-art game engines. To this end, the course will have a heavy programming focus. It will have a number of projects requiring students to apply the learned material to develop games using Unity 3D game engine. The students will develop games that run on a standalone PC, games that run on an Android platform and games that work in a multi-user mode.  In addition to learning the material and learning how to use game engines, the projects will provide students with portfolios of games they have developed. Such a portfolio is important in getting a job in game industry.    Prerequisite is 15-462 or contact the instructor for permission.",

    "description": "Creating intelligent robots can be viewed as the integration of many  pieces - \"bits\" - \"RoboBits\". This course will teach students such  \"RoboBits\" for creating both single and groups of intelligent  robots, with perception, cognition, and action. Students in the  course work with real functional mobile robots, equipped with RGB  and RGB+D cameras, different types of actuation, namely wheeled and  legged robots, and computation onboard. Students learn effective  vision processing algorithms for object recognition, motion modeling  and planning, robot localization and planning algorithms, and  multi-robot communication for shared sensing and teamwork.  We will  further study cognitive architectures, learning, and human-robot  interaction. 15-491 is a PROJECT-BASED course, which runs in the  CORAL research lab in GHC 3201. The course has three major projects  with specific tasks that incrementally lead to the research and  development of complete intelligent robots. The projects are  decomposed in weekly tasks. The class meets twice a week, and the  students have access to the lab for further work as needed.  Evaluation is based on class participation, weekly progress, and  project reports, presentations, and outcomes.",

Among the packages are Maple and Mathematica for symbolic computing, TeX and LaTeX for mathematical documents, and Matlab for numerical computing. The course will also introduce the mathematical facilities built into spreadsheets such as Excel. The aim of the course is to provide the student with some basic skills in the use of this software without attempting complete coverage. A deeper knowledge of the software will be easy to obtain after completing this course. There are no prerequisites for the course, other than basic computer literacy and a knowledge of elementary mathematics. It is suggested that the course should be taken during the first two years of undergraduate studies.",

    "description": "76-100 is an academic reading and writing course for multilingual students, especially those who are not native speakers of English or who consider English to be their weaker language.  The course, designed as a prerequisite for 76-101, emphasizes reading comprehension strategies for reading a variety of text types in English (e.g., journalism, textbook selections, popular press arguments, and academic journal articles). Throughout the semester, students use these sources to write summaries and short position papers. The course introduces students to readers' expectations for North American rhetorical style at the sentence, paragraph, and whole text or genre levels.  Within the course we discuss explicit genre and linguistic norms for writing in academic English so that writers can connect with their readers.  Students who take this course qualify through an online placement test that is administered through the university prior to the fall semester. (All sections are offered MWF).  Each 76-100 course is structured by the reading and writing objectives of the course as well as a vocabulary for writing in English, but some courses present different themes (or content) in their readings.",

    "description": "76-101 introduces first-year students to an advanced, inductive process for writing an argument from sources. Because the course is based upon empirical research about professional academic writers, students will learn expert practices for authoring their own arguments that contribute to an existing community of authors. Because reading and writing are inseparable practices for academic writing, students will read a variety of texts so that they can explore and critically evaluate a single issue from multiple perspectives and from different disciplinary genres. Students will learn methods for summarizing, synthesizing, and analyzing arguments within that issue so that they may contribute an argument of their own.  The course is also geared toward helping students understand the requirements of advanced college-level writing. Our students are typically very accomplished readers and writers, and we are eager to push their accomplishments toward greater excellence. For this purpose, students will build upon their composing knowledge by reflecting and thinking strategically as they plan, write, and revise their own texts. Ultimately, they will develop critical reading, rhetorical and linguistic practices for analyzing and producing texts within the context of an academic community.  Each section of 76-101 is structured by the same objectives and core assignments. There is a core vocabulary and set of heuristics that all sections teach. However, students may find particular issues more appealing than others-we encourage students to pursue their interests, but we also ask that students engage any 76-101 course with intellectual curiosity. Due to the limits of our schedule, we are unable to meet each student's individual preferences for course topics, but we do offer a wide variety from which to choose.

Through reading and writing in various genres, students will discover and discuss how creative writing engages with the world around us while also learning some of the important techniques of writing creatively. The class will read a number of books by authors in various genres, and students will have the opportunity to interact with these authors through public readings and classroom visits. In addition, the class will take advantage of other literary events happening around Pittsburgh in order to further engage with places where writing comes off the page and engages with the world. Revision will be required and emphasized.",

    "description": "Topics vary by semester. Fall 2014: In the first chapter of one of the most notorious college novels, Stover at Yale (1912), Dink Stover imagines the glories that await him when he arrives: ?They had begun at last ? the happy, care-free years that every one proclaimed. Four glorious years, good times, good fellows, and a free and open fight to be among the leaders and leave a name on the roll of fame. Only four years, and then the world with its perplexities and grinding trials.? The freshman of 2014, however, confront mounting student debt, accounts of gruesome college shootings, pressure to succeed from parents and peers, as well as the distractions of video games, college parties, and the internet. In this course we think about how we got here through the genre of the college novel, from the best selling classic, F. Scott Fitzgerald?s This Side of Paradise, to Zadie Smith?s On Beauty, to the best selling Pittsburgh based novel, Wonder Boys, by Michael Chabon.",

    "description": "It may seem more and more difficult to get a good classical, liberal education these days. The demands of professional training force many of us to skimp on our understanding of major artistic achievements. So, this class is for those people who should have read some of the best books around, but haven't managed to yet - books you should have read by now. Kurt Vonnegut's character Kilgore Trout sings the praises of Dostoevski's The Brothers Karamazov, (and the same thing might be said about Crime and Punishment) pointing out that it contains everything you need to know about life. He then ruefully adds that unfortunately that?s not enough anymore. It may not be enough, but it might be a place to start. Each book will be considered in itself for whatever it might offer by way of understanding the world, the past, the present, ourselves and others. Finally we shall use the idea that literature is equipment for living as a way of understanding and evaluating our experiences. Or: what use is it to have read some of the so-called \"great books\" of the Western canon? A recurrent interest will be in improving our language ability in general as we consider various books of central importance to our cultural traditions.",

    "description": "This course is an introduction to the history, technology, aesthetics and ideology of film.  Our main focus will be on the narrative fiction film, but we will also discuss documentaries, avant-garde work and animation.  The central organizing principle is historical, but there are a number of recurring thematic concerns.  These include an examination of the basic principles and terminology of filmmaking, the development of film technology, the definition of film as both art and business, and the history of film as an object of critical and cultural study.  The goals of this course are threefold.  First, it will provide you with a solid grounding in the key issues and concepts of film studies.  Second, it will expand your ability to knowledgeably critique individual cinematic works and their relationship to the larger culture.  Lastly, it will provide you with experience in expressing your critiques in essay form.",

Beginning with second wave feminism, we will trace the development of gender in theoretical and historical work to reflect on its shifting and contingent meanings. We will consider the ways in which gender operates in intersection with categories such as race, class, sexuality, religion, and nationality in global contexts. The course readings will also address how gender as an analytical category is redefined and transformed in an era of globalization, post humanism and new materialisms. We will use keywords and concepts acquired from academic sources to critically analyze themes of gendered performance and representation in literature, film, and television in a range of spheres such as family, culture, work, law, ecology and technology. Requirements for the course include regular participation and weekly blackboard entries, a short paper, a presentation, and a final research paper.",

    "description": "Most of Shakespeare?s comedies were written early in his career. The laughter they provoke is both festive and satirical, and they end in marriages. The darker (but more fantastic) plays we call romances were among the last drama he wrote. In this course we will be working out close readings of six very different representatives of the genre comedy and two from the genre romance. We will try to see these plays: 1) in relation to the culture for which they were written and which they helped shape--the newly established public theater in London, prevailing notions about social class and gender, Puritan attacks on play-going, and the like, and 2) in terms of \"what's in it for us\"?how current audiences and readers can enjoy and interpret these plays.  We will be considering what the plays have to say about the authoritative institutions and discourses of their time, and how they address us now that those institutions and discourses have been replaced by others.     On Mondays and Wednesdays the whole class will meet together, and smaller discussion groups will be held on Fridays. Students will be required to attend and participate regularly, submit brief responses on Blackboard, bring brief written analyses to discussions, write three prepared essays, and take a final exam",

    "description": "Poe defined the short story as something that could be read at one sitting. While simple enough, the definition in fact suggests a concern with concentrated form and unified artistic effect. In a sense, the short story has been around as long as people have been telling each other tales, but as a literary form it came into its own in modern times, during the 19th century, and it continues to be produced in considerable numbers. For many readers one of the great features is the one Poe pointed to, it is short. People who have never finished a novel by Henry James must be legion. So, with the short story, we can experience something with genuine literary merit, in an accessible form. Concentration, of course, can bring issues of comprehension and often short stories can seem puzzling, or incomplete to the average reader. This class will attempt to develop our abilities to read with care and attention--and feeling--in order to make us better readers of any artistic text. The challenges of the short form turn out to be excellent opportunities for learning a lot, in a little space. We?ll make use of several inexpensive anthologies, and look at one or two central writers (Hemingway and Borges) in more depth. The class will require the writing of a few short papers, engaging in online discussions on Blackboard, and three in class tests.  Students can expect to develop their historical understanding of current experience and to gain an understanding of how to interpret and comment on significant pieces of fiction. They will become familiar with some key ideas about the nature of short stories in general and the interpretation of texts., and will engage in an attempt to develop a theory of the aesthetic nature of short fiction.",

Students will read screenplays to see how scripts provide the blueprints for the final product, and write analytical papers.

We will strive to understand not just traditionally used methods (such as text analysis), but also more recent developments borrowed from other disciplines (such as history and sociology, anthropology, and visual studies). We will cover methods for developing topics, constructing research plans, finding and using scholarly sources and conducting field research, organizing, writing, revising, and presenting a research paper of 20-25 pages.  Students will also learn how to situate their work in the context of scholarly conversation, by testing their hypotheses against alternative and presenting their research to audiences in the field of English studies. Throughout the semester, students will develop and work on an original research project. At the end of the semester, students will give a public presentation of their research to other students and English faculty.",
